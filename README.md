when client connect to server it first does 3 way TCP handshake followed by a TLS handshake and exhange key (diffie hellman) than that encrypts client communication

## Multitenancy

Software multitenancy is a software architecture in which a single instance of software runs on a server and serves multiple tenants. Systems designed in such manner are "shared"
