# IP

Layer 3 Protocol (Network Layer)

The Internet Protocol (IP) is a protocol.

In networking, a protocol is a set of rules for formatting and processing data. Network protocols are like a common language for computers. The computers within a network may use vastly different software and hardware; however, the use of protocols enables them to communicate with each other regardless.

Each IP packet contains both a header (20 or 24 bytes long) and data (variable length). The header includes the IP addresses of the source and destination, plus other fields that help to route the packet. The data is the actual content, such as a string of letters or part of a webpage.

## IP Address

An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to a device or domain that connects to the Internet. Each IP address is a series of characters, such as '192.168.1.1'. Via DNS resolvers, which translate human-readable domain names into IP addresses, users are able to access websites without memorizing this complex series of characters. Each IP packet will contain both the IP address of the device or domain sending the packet and the IP address of the intended recipient, much like how both the destination address and the return address are included on a piece of mail.

## IPv4 vs. IPv6
The fourth version of IP (IPv4 for short) was introduced in 1983. However, just as there are only so many possible permutations for automobile license plate numbers and they have to be reformatted periodically, the supply of available IPv4 addresses has become depleted. IPv6 addresses have many more characters and thus more permutations; however, IPv6 is not yet completely adopted, and most domains and devices still have IPv4 addresses.
