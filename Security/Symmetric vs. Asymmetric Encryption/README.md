# Symmetric and Asymmetric Keys

- Encryption: It is the process of locking up information using cryptography. Information that has been locked this way is encrypted.
- Decryption: The process of unlocking the encrypted information using cryptographic techniques.
- Key: A secret like a password used to encrypt and decrypt information. There are a few different types of keys used in cryptography.
- Steganography: It is actually the science of hiding information from people who would snoop on you. The difference between steganography and encryption is that the would-be snoopers may not be able to tell thereâ€™s any hidden information in the first place.

## Symmetric Encryption
- Blowfish, AES, RC4, DES, RC5, and RC6 are examples of symmetric encryption. The most widely used symmetric algorithm is AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256.
- The main disadvantage of the symmetric key encryption is that all parties involved have to exchange the key used to encrypt the data before they can decrypt it.

## Asymmetric Encryption
- Popular asymmetric key encryption algorithm includes EIGamal, RSA, DSA, Elliptic curve techniques, PKCS.
